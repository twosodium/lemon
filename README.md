# Lemon

## Inspiration
Reducing food waste is one of the most effective ways to combat climate change. In fact, food waste has an environmental footprint 248x bigger than plastic.  üåç
As we did research and analyzed the root causes of food waste, we found out that more than 1.2 billion tonnes of fruit and veg are lost in farms, even before they reach the markets. But why?
In the U.S., more than 50% of produce is thrown away because it‚Äôs considered **"too ugly"** ‚Äî that‚Äôs about 60 million tons of _perfectly_ edible fruits and veggies. 
One of our team members has seen firsthand how healthy and edible produce gets discarded just because it doesn‚Äôt look "perfect". This issue is REAL and needs to be addressed.

## What it does
To solve this problem, we built Lemon. üçãüå±

Lemon is an app that connects farmers, businesses, and customers to reduce food waste and fight climate change. By signing up as a customer, you can access discounted, surplus produce from local farmers that would otherwise go to waste. Producers (farmers) can create listings for their surplus or "wonky" produce, allowing them to sell items that are perfectly good but not deemed aesthetically pleasing enough for traditional markets. Businesses can also shop for discounted produce like customers, but they have the added benefit of forming long-term partnerships with local farmers. Lemon‚Äôs goal is to raise awareness about the impact of food waste, making it easier for everyone to make sustainable shopping choices and contribute to a greener, more connected world.

**Painpoints**
‚ùìMany consumers want to make sustainable choices but don‚Äôt know how. Lemon makes it easy by offering access to eco-friendly food at discounted prices. 
üçè Farmers with surplus & 'imperfect' produce get to sell their produce, creating a new source of income and increasing their positive impact on the environment.
üëâ Businesses get to access locally-produced crops with much lower prices and build long-term partnerships with producers, while being spotlighted to customers in their city and getting recognition.

**Broader context**
Lemon‚Äôs focus on reducing food waste aligns with environmental regulations. The U.S. government has set a goal to cut food waste in half by 2030 through various initiatives and consumer education. Some states are even passing legislation to restrict the amount of food waste going to landfills.
Lemon has strong word-of-mouth potential, driven by eco-conscious consumers as well as farmers who are profiting out of Lemon. We also incorporated share buttons on our app so that users can share the app with their friends.

**Market & Impact**
With 60 million tons of wasted produce every year in the U.S., the opportunity for a sustainable solution is enormous. The demand for eco-friendly food options is growing rapidly.

**Stakeholder Incentives**
Farmers: sell produce that would otherwise go to waste; a new source of income.
Customers: get fresh, discounted produce; contribute to sustainability.
Businesses: get fresh, discounted produce in bulk; get recognition for sustainability efforts.


## How we built it
We brought our vision for Lemon using Flutterflow. After drawing a Lo-fi prototype, taking user experiences into account, we started familiarizing ourself with Flutterflow and got to building. We used Supabase as our database. Through Flutterflow's special access to its pro plan, we collaborated and operated tasks between each team member.


## Challenges we ran into
Familiarizing ourselves with a completely new environment, Flutterflow, was challenging at first. This is the first hackathon experience of all team members, making the process extremely exciting but challenging at the same time. Some things we spent a bit more time we probably needed to were üôÉ
- Setting up the database and user authentication
- Product listings 
- Shopping cart 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are super proud of all the progress we made! Starting with only an interest in contributing to sustainability to landing on an idea to building it out with Flutterflow, we accomplished so much that we are proud to showcase.


## What we learned
We are amazed to see how fast we were able to pick up how Flutterflow works and our ability to familiarize ourselves with a new tool showed us the importance of transferrable skills, like logic. It also demonstrated that 'hackers' should be quick to adapt and fast learners.


## What's next for Lemon
We are looking forward to getting feedback on our app, its design, and functionality. We hope to make iterations based on the feedback. We will have access to Flutterflow for two more months and who knows --maybe we'll even get to publish our app!
